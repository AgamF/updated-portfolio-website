        programming languages, concepts, methodologies and so much more.<br/><br/>

        As of october 2022, I became proficient at 7 programming languages & have over 12 maintained projects on Github, <br/> and I came to an understanding that i love programming and that i am very passionate <br/>
        about problem-solving. Gym is essential, Chess is for life â™¥. <br/><br/>
